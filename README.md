# Audio Structure Analysis: "Op de block" by Kevin & Emms

For this analysis, I looked at the pitch data (chromagram) from "Op de block" by Kevin and Emms to see how the song is built. Because it is a hip-hop track, the song relies on a repeating instrumental loop, which is very easy to spot in these three graphs.

**1. Chromagram: Pitch Over Time**
This graph shows which musical notes are playing throughout the song. Since the beat stays the same for most of the track, you can see strong, solid horizontal lines. These lines show the main instrumental loop playing over and over. When these lines fade or change slightly, it means there is a break or shift in the song, like when Kevin stops rapping and Emms starts singing the hook.

**2. Self-Similarity Matrix (Cosine Distance)**
This graph compares the song to itself to show repeating harmonies. The closely packed diagonal lines next to the main center line prove that the beat is a constant loop. Every time the main chord progression repeats, a new diagonal line appears. This shows that the background music stays pretty much exactly the same, whether the song is in a verse or the chorus.

**3. Self-Similarity Matrix (Manhattan Distance)**
By using a different calculation (Manhattan distance) and color scheme, this graph highlights the big structural changes in the song instead of just the repeating chords. You can see clear, checkerboard-like blocks here. Even though the main chords keep looping, other parts of the song change—instruments drop in and out, and the vocals switch between Kevin and Emms. The darker blocks make it easy to see exactly where these big section changes happen, like moving from the verse to the hook or the bridge.
